## Predict-survival-rate-using-Titanic-dataset--K-Nearest-Neighbour-Classifier-Project-

### Define the question
Use K Nearest Neighbour to predict survival rate using Titanic dataset.

### Metric for success
Determine the split test/train percentage with best accuracy score. Determine the K with the best accuracy Determine the K with the least error

### The context
Use K Nearest Neighbour to predict survival rate using Titanic dataset.

### Experimental design taken
We will use K Nearest Classification

### Appropriateness of available data to answer the given question.
The available data is from Titanic dataset.Since we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.
